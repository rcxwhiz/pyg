In order to make this autograder useful & simple, students will need to have a line on every file to load some data
This data will be the commands or data which the students will use to output the files

To make it easy on the student, the grader will just run the student's file in a directory with just the specific file
Could include a batch and sh file for students to run or they could run it in spyder or something

The points will be awarded base on output matching or beginning with certain things
Graphs will be compared as images

The student version will have a small GUI that simply says "please put your file here {file path + name}" and has
a single run button, then it either has some popup or something showing what points were achieved and lost with
comparisons between the student outfiles and the given key outfiles
The thing the student downloads should make it easy to tell which inputs go to which outputs

There could also be criteria for certain function definitions to be included too? This could also be used to say there
will be custom headers / footers for fun things like a timed program or seeing if you can succeed with executing a
given function.

In the end when you run the instructor program, it will give you some sort of csv or table with what all the students
did and didn't get with a lot of homework stats and such
A classlist could be imported/exported to keep track of people who didn't turn in the HW?

Could make the points awarded progressive on number of cases passed or number of lines matched
Could be set to some default linear scale of lines or test cases matched
How would there be custom criteria for having certain things in the code?
I will need to write out a few rubrics to figure it out

There should still be an option to grade (or at least look at) excel files
Could actually grade them if given a template, could have a UI where you select the cells that matter
Could test to see if the cell value vs equation are the same to make sure they didn't just punch it in

There should be some built in diff checking to show what % similarity there is between student files

There should be a log of files run that would be nice, there also needs to be some way to store the criteria

Could possibly have a thing where it helps you enter stuff by copying the scores for you?

Perhaps I should add linenumbers to the text viewers somehow?

Maybe the way the ruberic should be made is with a .ini file?

Could filter separater characters to stop people from saving files anywhere bad because they already can't get anywhere
because there are no os or sys modules
