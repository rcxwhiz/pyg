In order to make this autograder useful & simple, students will need to have a line on every file to load some data
This data will be the commands or data which the students will use to output the files

To make it easy on the student, the grader will just run the student's file in a directory with just the specific file

There will need to be headers and footers added to the students files to make the code die if it runs too long and
put it in the right working directory

The key files can either be saved as .py files or output.txt and graph.png files

The points will be awarded base on output matching or beginning with certain things
Graphs will be compared as images

This will be a terminal program, but it would be nice if it had an interface

The program should make a directory for you, and have some way of knowing if a selected directory is already a grader
directory?

Maybe there should be a student version that is just a GUI program they download that's ready to go?
They would get some saved output and input files
The program should just have an option to generate input and output stuff but then run off of saved inputs and outputs
You just choose which cases you want to send the students and it will make a zip that they can run to test their code
Note - if they have anaconda they should have pyqt, don't want to make an exe because mac kids

The student version will have a small GUI that simply says "please put your file here {file path + name}" and has
a single run button, then it either has some popup or something showing what points were achieved and lost with
comparisons between the student outfiles and the given key outfiles
The thing the student downloads should make it easy to tell which inputs go to which outputs

There could also be criteria for certain function definitions to be included too?

In the end when you run the instructor program, it will give you some sort of csv or table with what all the students
did and didn't get with a lot of homework stats and such
A classlist could be imported/exported to keep track of people who didn't turn in the HW?

There needs to be a way to reweight everything to 100

If the students are beginners, they should probably be given the code that loads the input

Maybe there could be an option to have no input or to hide the output

Run student result stuff will go in a zip
